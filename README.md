## Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some
interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, 
and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. 
The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

- Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
- Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus
